Hello, I am Arda Eker. I graduated from Mersin University Vocational School of Technical Sciences in 2022 with a degree in Computer Programming. During this time, I worked on various projects to improve my knowledge and skills. I have been working as a freelancer for about a year now and during this time I have focused on continuously improving myself. I usually use technologies such as Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Mongo DB, MSSQL and I am constantly training myself to improve my skills in this field.
